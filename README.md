# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Model

This project involves developing a loan prediction model to automate real-time loan eligibility assessments based on customer details provided in online application forms. The model employs the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to analyze features such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and other relevant details. The primary objective is to identify customer segments eligible for loans, allowing insurance companies to target these customers more effectively. Several libraries, including numpy, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn, were utilized for data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation. This comprehensive approach ensures accurate and efficient loan eligibility predictions, streamlining the loan approval process and enhancing customer targeting strategies for insurance companies.
